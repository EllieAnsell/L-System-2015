#Computing For Animation 1 Assignment, Year 2. 

This repository contains the files I used for my computing assignment during my second year of university. I chose to make an L-system, using the NGL graphics library created by Jon Macey, Bournemouth University programming lecturer, and openGL and C++.

The program lets you build an L-system, which reacts to changes in wind speed and direction, and grows when it rains. It orients towards the sun which you can move around the scene, and includes basic functions such as camera panning and orienting with the mouse. 

Please see the video in FinalSubmission/04_Video to see the video of the results.
